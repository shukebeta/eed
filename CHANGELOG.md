- 42ba91f — 2025-09-29 21:23 — Refactor script processing to ensure w/q commands are always present
- 83b1936 — 2025-09-29 20:10 — Add auto-completion for missing w/q commands in ed scripts

## 2025-09-28
- af0099f — 2025-09-28 14:30 — Add smart git integration and auto-commit mode
  - Introduced auto-commit mode: `-m/--message` applies edits and creates an atomic `eed-history:` commit inside git repos.
- e1b1beb — 2025-09-28 16:05 — Improve --undo to use git revert for non-destructive history preservation
- 6f8acfc — 2025-09-28 16:15 — Fix WIP auto-save to detect all changes, preventing data loss
- f429add — 2025-09-28 17:34 — Add cross-platform relative path calculation and transparency notifications for staged files

## 2025-09-18
- 9416417 — 2025-09-18 09:37 — Removing --force plus adding local history system with commit/undo workflow using git integration
  - Removed the earlier `--force` behavior in favor of a safer preview-first + local history workflow.
  - Introduced `commit <file> "message"` helper that applies preview files and creates atomic `eed-history:` commits.
  - Added `eed --undo` to revert the last `eed-history` commit safely.
- 91f90bc — 2025-09-18 14:20 — Refactor dot trap detection logic for improved accuracy and consistency

## 2025-09-06 and earlier (selected)
- 222f46b — 2025-09-05 22:31 — Add intelligent slash escaping for AI-generated ed commands
- a88b199 — 2025-09-05 22:49 — Complete intelligent slash escaping with full integration tests
  - Auto-fix for unescaped slashes / regex delimiters to reduce common AI-generated syntax errors.
- 4ed88cd — 2025-09-06 13:13 — Refactor auto-fix script for better organization and performance
- 6d16021 — 2025-09-02 21:45 — Fix Git Bash test compatibility and improve cross-platform reliability
- 40b7255 — 2025-09-01 16:51 — Normalize line endings for cross-platform compatibility

## 2025-08-31 and early foundation work
- 8493b2a — 2025-08-31 19:33 — Extract reordering functions to separate eed_reorder.sh module
- c89fe72 — 2025-08-31 20:30 — Unified error reporting via error_exit() and related refactors
  - These foundational refactors extracted core responsibilities (reordering, validation, input handling) into separate modules to improve testability and maintainability.

Upgrade notes / user-facing guidance
- Preview-first workflow: The `--force` flag was removed; prefer the preview-confirm flow and the new auto-commit (`-m`) for atomic commits inside git repositories.
- Auto-commit and local-history: Use `eed -m "message" path/to/file - <<'EOF'` to apply edits and create an `eed-history:` commit atomically. Use `commit <file> "message"` to apply preview-mode edits.
- Undo: `eed --undo` provides an easier, safer way to revert the last eed-managed commit.
- Auto-completion & auto-fix: eed now auto-completes missing `w`/`q` and attempts to fix unterminated input blocks and unescaped slashes to reduce common edit script errors generated by AI.
- Cross-platform: Prefer Unix-style forward slashes for paths and use Git Bash on Windows for heredoc examples. The tool includes several cross-platform fixes (line ending normalization, git root path normalization).
- Emergency override: `EED_FORCE_OVERRIDE` exists for emergency use only; it bypasses safety checks and is not recommended for normal workflows.

If you want, I can:
- Commit and push CHANGELOG.md to the readme/update-from-commits branch and prepare the PR body, or
- Adjust the changelog format (keep per-date entries, add versioned headings like v2.0/v2.1, or generate a condensed "Unreleased" section).
