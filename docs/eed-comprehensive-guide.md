# Enhanced Ed (eed) - Comprehensive Guide

This is the complete reference for using `eed` effectively. Read this file to understand `eed`'s full capabilities.

## CRITICAL REMINDER FOR CLAUDE

STOP BEFORE EDITING: When you need to modify a file, your first instinct will be to use Edit/MultiEdit. RESIST THIS URGE.

ALWAYS ASK YOURSELF: Am I about to use Edit/MultiEdit/Write? If yes, STOP and use `eed` instead.

MENTAL CHECKLIST:
1. Need to modify a file? Use `eed` via Bash tool
2. About to call Edit tool? STOP, use `eed` instead
3. Complex multi-line changes? `eed` handles it better
4. Simple one-line change? Still use `eed` for consistency

CORRECT PATTERN - always use this via Bash tool:
```bash
eed --force /unix/style/path/to/file "$(cat <<'EOF'  # <-- Single quotes are CRITICAL!
# ed commands
w
q
EOF
)"
```

CRITICAL PATH RULE: Always use Unix-style paths with forward slashes.
NEVER use Windows paths (C:\path\to\file). Always use forward slashes (/), as backslashes will break shell commands.

MEMORY AID: Think "forward slashes" not "backslashes".

EFFICIENCY TIP: Use `--force` to skip preview when confident
- Preview mode: Good for learning and complex changes
- Force mode: Use when you trust your `ed` commands

## Overview

`eed` is a non-interactive wrapper around `ed` that makes programmatic editing safe: preview changes, back up atomically, then apply.

**Key Features:**
- **Preview-Confirm** â€” preview diffs before applying
- **Atomic** â€” all-or-nothing edits
- **Backup** â€” edits written to `<file>.eed.preview` in preview mode (or moved into place in `--force`)
- **Smart** â€” classifies view vs modify commands
- **Auto-reorder** â€” reorders simple line-number edits to avoid conflicts
- **Forgiving stdin mode** if a user pipes a script but omits the `-` argument, `eed` will read stdin, proceed, and after success print a friendly, educational tip rather than failing

## Usage Syntax (preferred examples first)

```bash
eed [--debug] [--force] [--disable-auto-reorder] <file> {SCRIPT|-}
```

Important: `SCRIPT` may be provided as an explicit string, `-` to force reading from stdin, or via a pipe/quoted heredoc.

Recommended usage patterns (priority order):

1) Pipe (quick & script-friendly)
```bash
printf '1d\nw\nq\n' | eed path/to/file -        # explicit stdin with '-'
```
Note: `eed` also supports a forgiving mode â€” if you pipe but omit the `-`, eed will still read stdin and proceed, and will append a friendly tip on success. For clarity and reproducibility, prefer the explicit `-` when scripting.

2) Quoted heredoc with explicit `-` (robust, readable)
```bash
eed path/to/file - <<'EOF'
1d
w
q
EOF
```

3) Quoted heredoc as an argument (self-contained / single-arg)
```bash
eed path/to/file "$(cat <<'EOF'
1d
w
q
EOF
)"
```

**Options:**
- `--debug` â€” Show detailed execution info, preserve temp files
- `--force` â€” Skip preview-confirm workflow, apply edits directly
- `--disable-auto-reorder` â€” Disable automatic script reordering (expert mode)

## The Preview-Confirm Workflow

Example (canonical quoted heredoc form):
```bash
eed sample.txt "$(cat <<'EOF'
2c
new content
.
w
q
EOF
)"
```

âœ“ Edits are applied to a preview file (`sample.txt.eed.preview`); review the diff and decide to apply or discard.

```
--- sample.txt      2025-08-23 14:30:15.000000000 +1200
+++ sample.txt.eed.preview 2025-08-23 14:30:20.000000000 +1200
@@ -1,3 +1,3 @@
 line1
 new content
 line3
```

To apply these changes, run:
```bash
mv 'sample.txt.eed.preview' 'sample.txt'
```

To discard these changes, run:
```bash
rm 'sample.txt.eed.preview'
```

### View Operations Execute Directly

Read-only operations run immediately; still prefer quoted heredoc for safety:
```bash
eed file.txt "$(cat <<'EOF'
,p
q
EOF
)"
```

## Forgiving stdin mode

Behavior:
- If `eed` is invoked with a single non-flag positional argument (the target `FILE`) and there is data on stdin (pipeline), `eed` will assume the user intended to pass the script via stdin (they may have forgotten the `-` argument).
- `eed` will read stdin into the script, proceed normally (validation, reorder, preview/force), and â€” on *successful completion* â€” will print a friendly, non-blaming, educational tip to stdout indicating it handled stdin for this run.

Tip wording (recommended):
- `ðŸ’¡ Tip: The '-' argument for stdin mode was missing. I handled it for you this time, but it's best practice to include it for clarity (e.g., '... | eed path/to/file -').`

Notes:
- `eed` does NOT silently mutate behavior â€” it explicitly reports when the auto-read occurred.
- The tip is printed only after a successful operation (view or edit), so users learn in a positive context.
- For scripting and CI, prefer the explicit `-` to avoid relying on forgiving behavior.

## Ed Command Reference

### Basic Line Addressing
```bash
5           # Line 5
$           # Last line
.           # Current line
1,5         # Lines 1 through 5
1,$         # Entire file
```

### Essential Commands
```bash
# View
,p          # Print all lines
1,5p        # Print lines 1-5
=           # Show line count
n           # Print with line numbers

# Edit
5d          # Delete line 5
1,5d        # Delete lines 1-5
5i          # Insert before line 5 (end with .)
5a          # Append after line 5 (end with .)
5c          # Change line 5 (end with .)

# Search & Replace
/pattern/   # Find pattern
s/old/new/g # Replace all on current line
1,$s/old/new/g  # Replace all in file

# Global Operations
g/pattern/d     # Delete all lines with pattern
g/pattern/p     # Print all lines with pattern
v/pattern/d     # Delete all lines WITHOUT pattern

# File Operations
w           # Write (save)
q           # Quit (will fail if changes are unsaved)
Q           # Force Quit (discards any unsaved changes)
```

## Automatic Safety Features

`eed` provides intelligent safety features that work behind the scenes.

### Smart Line Number Reordering
Automatically reorders operations to prevent line number conflicts:
- `1d; 5d; 10d` becomes `10d; 5d; 1d`
- Preserves multi-line input commands as atomic units
- Warns about complex patterns that can't be safely reordered

### Complex Pattern Detection
Detects potentially dangerous patterns and disables auto-reordering:
- Global commands (`g/pattern/d`, `v/pattern/p`)
- Overlapping address ranges (`3,5d` + `5a`)
- Non-numeric addresses (`./pattern/`, `$-5`)
- Move/transfer operations (`1,5m10`)

### Shell Safety
Prevents history expansion issues with exclamation marks in bash syntax.

## Best Practices

### Shell safety & quoting (preferred)
Always use a quoted heredoc (`<<'EOF'`) so the shell doesn't expand variables or backticks.

### Nested Heredoc Naming Convention (and why to avoid nesting)
Every heredoc marker must be unique within the entire command. In practice we've observed AIs repeatedly make mistakes with nested heredocs even after warnings â€” the safest rule is: avoid nesting heredocs whenever possible.
### Heredoc nesting trap detection

- eed includes a validation check that detects *standalone heredoc delimiters* (e.g. a line with only `EOF`) inside the final ED script. This typically indicates a nested-heredoc parsing mistake where the shell closed an inner heredoc early, truncating the script passed to eed.
- When detected, eed halts the run and prints an explanatory, AI-friendly message with suggested fixes.

Why this matters:
- A truncated ED script can cause `ed` to silently perform no edits (or behave unexpectedly) while returning success, producing confusing "silent failures".
- This validation prevents those silent failures and provides actionable guidance.

Example (what the validator catches):
```bash
# BAD: leftover EOF inside the script indicates a nested-heredoc mistake
eed file.txt "$(cat <<'OUTER'
10a
Some text
EOF    # <-- stray EOF left in the final script
.
w
q
OUTER
)"
```

Suggested fixes:
- Use unique delimiters for nested heredocs (e.g. `INNER` / `OUTER`) or avoid nesting entirely.
- Prefer piping commands or using an explicit stdin `-` instead of nesting, for example:
```bash
# Pipe example
printf '1,$s/old/new/g\nw\nq\n' | eed path/to/file -

# Or heredoc to stdin (no nesting)
eed path/to/file - <<'EOF'
1,$s/old/new/g
w
q
EOF
```

Implementation notes:
- The detection logic is implemented in [`lib/eed_validator.sh`](lib/eed_validator.sh:40) and integrated into the pre-validation step of the main script [`eed`](eed:103).
- You can adjust the list of markers (`EOF`, `EOT`, `HEREDOC`) in the validator if you need to support other project-specific markers.

Why avoid nesting
- Nested heredocs are fragile: it's easy to reuse the same marker by accident, causing silent parsing errors or truncated input.
- Debugging nested heredocs is time-consuming for humans and brittle for automated agents.
- Multiple simple edits are clearer, safer, and easier to review than one deeply nested command.

Recommended alternatives (safer, easier for AIs)

1) Perform multiple sequential edits (preferred)
Break complex transformations into discrete steps and run `eed` for each step. This is simple and auditable:
```bash
# Step 1: update imports
eed file.js "$(cat <<'EOF'
1i
import newModule from 'library';
.
w
q
EOF
)"

# Step 2: rename usages
eed file.js "$(cat <<'EOF'
1,$s/oldName/newName/g
w
q
EOF
)"
```
Staging and committing between steps (e.g., `git add` / `git commit`) makes changes easy to review and revert.

2) Use a temporary ed script file and read via stdin (no nesting)
Write the ed commands to a separate file and feed it to `eed` with an explicit `-`:
```bash
cat > edits.ed <<'EOF'
1,$s/oldName/newName/g
w
q
EOF

# Run eed reading edits.ed via stdin
eed path/to/file - < edits.ed
```
Or pipe the commands:
```bash
printf '1,$s/oldName/newName/g\nw\nq\n' | eed path/to/file -
```

3) Use a single heredoc (no nested heredocs)
If you must include other commands, prefer separating concerns so only one heredoc is needed for `eed`:
```bash
# Avoid embedding another heredoc marker inside the one for eed
eed path/to/file "$(cat <<'EED_CMDS'
/pattern/
c
replacement
.
w
q
EED_CMDS
)"
```

Practical tips
- Prefer option (1) or (2) for AI-driven or CI workflows.
- When using multiple edits, use `git` to create checkpoints between steps.
- If you must nest, ensure all markers are unique and simple (e.g., `EOF1`, `EOF2`) and run the command locally once to verify parsing.
- For reproducibility in CI, prefer explicit `-` (stdin) or temp script files rather than relying on the forgiving stdin auto-detection.

This guidance reduces brittle failures and makes AI-driven edits far more reliable.

### Always end with `w` and `q`
- For editing operations: always finish with `w` and `q`.
- For view-only operations: `q` is sufficient.

### Use `--debug` for development
`--debug` preserves temp files and prints the temporary command file and ed output.

## Common Patterns

### Adding Import Statements
```bash
eed file.js "$(cat <<'EOF'
1i
import newModule from 'library';
.
w
q
EOF
)"
```

### Global Find and Replace
```bash
eed file.txt "$(cat <<'EOF'
1,$s/oldFunction/newFunction/g
w
q
EOF
)"
```

### Remove Debug Statements
```bash
eed file.js "$(cat <<'EOF'
g/console\.log/d
w
q
EOF
)"
```

### Multi-Step Editing
```bash
eed file.txt "$(cat <<'EOF'
/TODO/
c
DONE: Task completed
.
/FIXME/
d
w
q
EOF
)"
```

## Exit Codes

- `0` â€” Success (view or applied edit)
- `1` â€” Usage error or general `ed`-level error
- `2` â€” File I/O error
- `3` â€” Internal `ed` error

## Error Recovery

If something goes wrong:
```bash
# Check for preview/backup
ls -la yourfile.eed.preview

# Restore if needed
mv yourfile.eed.preview yourfile.txt

# Or revert using git
git checkout -- yourfile.txt
```

**Best practice**: After each successful edit, stage your progress with `git add yourfile.txt` to create safe restore points.

## Advanced Usage

### Preview Mode vs Force Mode
```bash
# Preview mode (default) - safe for experimentation
eed file.txt "$(cat <<'EOF'
1,$s/old/new/g
w
q
EOF
)"

# Force mode - direct editing
eed --force file.txt "$(cat <<'EOF'
1,$s/old/new/g
w
q
EOF
)"
```

### Combining with Other Tools
```bash
# First examine the file
cat file.txt | head -20

# Then edit with eed
eed file.txt "$(cat <<'EOF'
10,15d
w
q
EOF
)"

# Verify results
git diff file.txt
```

## Tests & CI

A dedicated test covering the forgiving stdin mode was added:
- `tests/test_eed_stdin.bats` â€” verifies auto-read when `-` is omitted and that the post-success tip is printed.
Run the full test suite locally:
```bash
bats tests
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Unexpected shell expansion** â€” Use single-quoted heredoc markers.
2. **Missing terminator** â€” Ensure the lone `.` ends multi-line insert/change blocks.
3. **Complex pattern warnings** â€” `eed` detected unsafe patterns; review or use `--disable-auto-reorder`.
4. **Preview files left behind** â€” Normal in preview mode; clean up manually if needed.

### Getting Help
Use `--debug` to see the temp command file and ed output:
```bash
eed --debug file.txt 'your commands here'
```

---

**Remember:** The forgiving stdin mode and post-success tip are meant to reduce friction without hiding behavior. Prefer explicit `-` in scripts; enjoy safe, previewable edits with `eed`.

## Intelligent Safety Override

eed includes an intelligent safety override system that protects against potentially dangerous --force operations.

### How It Works

When you use --force mode, eed analyzes the script for high-risk patterns:

- **Complex patterns**: Global commands (g/, v/), move/transfer operations (m, t)
- **Unordered operations**: Line number operations not in descending order
- **Risk assessment**: High-risk = complex patterns + unordered operations

### Override Behavior

For high-risk scripts, --force is automatically ignored and preview mode is used instead:

```bash
# This will trigger safety override
echo 'g/pattern/d
1d
3d
w
q' | eed --force file.txt -

# Output:
# ðŸ’¡ Complex script detected (--force disabled)
```

### Bypass Options

**Environment Variable:**
```bash
EED_FORCE_OVERRIDE=1 eed --force file.txt script.ed
```

**Script Simplification:**
- Use descending order: 3d, 1d instead of 1d, 3d
- Avoid mixing global commands with line operations

### Machine Integration

CI/automation scripts can:
- Check stderr for `Complex script detected` message
- Set `EED_FORCE_OVERRIDE=1` to bypass when appropriate  
- Exit codes remain unchanged (preview success = 0)

This system prevents accidental file corruption while maintaining full user control.
